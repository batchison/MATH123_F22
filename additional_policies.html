<p id="p-36"><em class="alert">Academic Support Services:</em> Tutoring is available for most 100 and 200-level courses through the Department of Mathematics, as well as the Center for Academic Support and Achievement (CASA).  Additionally, Supplemental Instruction may be available for certain sections of 100 and 200-level courses.  Students are encouraged to work in groups on any assignments, especially when no campus support is available.  All students who are struggling with the material are strongly encouraged to utilize the instructor's office hours.</p>
<p id="p-37">Framingham State University offers equal opportunities to all qualified students, including those with disabilities and impairments.  The University is committed to making reasonable accommodations as are necessary to ensure that its programs and activities do not discriminate, or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of disability.  Academic Support serves students with learning and psychiatric disabilities as well as students with visual, mobility and hearing impairments.  For further information about this, please visit the link for disability services through the CASA website or contact Dr. LaDonna Bridges, Associate Dean of Academic Success and Director of CASA, at <a href="mailto:lbridges@framingham.edu">lbridges@framingham.edu</a> or Ms. Tanya Milette , Associate Director of Disability and Access Services at <a href="mailto:tmilette@framingham.edu">tmilette@framingham.edu</a>.</p>
<p id="p-38"><em class="alert">FSU Notice on Sexual Harrassment:</em> Framingham State University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy learning, living and working environment that is free from all forms of sexual violence, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and retaliation.  If you or someone you know has experienced any form of sexual or gender-based misconduct, we urge you to visit the SHAPE website at <span class="process-math">\(\href{https://www.framingham.edu/student-life/shape/}{https://www.framingham.edu/student-life/shape/}\)</span> for information regarding on-campus and community resources, University policy, contact information for the Title IX Coordinators, confidential and non-confidential reporting options, victim rights, and more.</p>
<p id="p-39"><em class="alert">FSU Notice of Non-Discrimination and Diversity:</em> Framingham State University is committed to a policy of non-discrimination, equal opportunity, diversity, and affirmative action. The University is dedicated to providing educational, working, and living environments that value the diverse backgrounds of all people.   Furthermore, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act ("MCRA," M.G.L. c. 12, §§ 11H, 11I, 11J) protects the rights of all residents of and visitors to Massachusetts to be free from bias-motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with their civil rights. The MCRA protects the right to attend school, live peacefully, and enjoy other basic rights.</p>
<p id="p-40"><em class="alert">Antiracism at FSU:</em> At Framingham State University, faculty, staff, and students work together to sustain a learning, working, and living community free from hate, discrimination, harassment, and intolerance. We recognize the damaging effects of systemic racism—including policies, structures, and historic practices—on the experience and success of communities of color. Coming from different backgrounds and different levels of privilege, we can all affirm and engage in antiracist work.</p>
<p id="p-41">Diversity of voices, and of minds, strengthens our ability to solve problems and to ask and answer questions about the world we share. As your instructor, I commit to upholding community values of inclusion, civility, accessibility, and mutual respect. I expect this class to commit to creating a community that affirms and welcomes all persons from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and supports the realization of everyone’s potential.</p>
<p id="p-42"><em class="alert">Email Policy:</em> It is the policy of the University to use framingham.edu email addresses for all official email correspondence between faculty, staff, and students.  In order to insure that your email address is correct, students should make their student.framingham.edu address the preferred email address in both Canvas and myFramingham.  All important course documents will be posted on the designated Canvas site.</p>
<p id="p-43"><em class="alert">Recording of Lectures:</em> This class will use video and audio recordings of faculty and students, both online and in person, to better support learning in a blended format.  By enrolling in the course, students are consenting to being recorded in this class and may only withdraw such consent by informing the course instructor in writing. As these recordings may contain intellectual property as well as confidential student information (ex. student names, likenesses), sharing or transferring recordings of such content by any method currently available or any method that may become available in the future is not allowed, and copies of such recordings should not be provided to others; uploaded, linked, embedded, or otherwise posted  via file-sharing, social media, or other sites or services which could enable anyone to view or hear them who is not currently enrolled in the course; or share them in any other way.  Access to video and audio recordings in this class is for personal educational use only and is available only to individuals currently enrolled in the class, unless faculty permission is expressly granted. Recording and/or sharing course materials, including video and audio files, without the written consent of the course instructor is a violation of University policies (ex. academic honesty) and will be reported to the College Dean for further action and/or discipline.</p>
<p id="p-44"><em class="alert">OER and Copyright Information:</em> This course is designed using free and open educational resources (OER) when available.  It is possible, however, that your instructor may utilize copyrighted educational materials, which is in compliance with U.S. Copyright Law.  Under that law, such materials may not be saved to your computer, revised, copied, or distributed without permission.  Students may freely download and print any OER used.  You may only download or print copyrighted materials, however, at the direction of your instructor.</p>
<p id="p-45">The instructor reserves the right to make changes to this syllabus at any time.</p></section></div></main>
